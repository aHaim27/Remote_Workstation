# 🖥️🛜 Remote Workstation – Project Overview

This repository documents the process of building a powerful workstation designed to be accessed remotely from my MacBook Pro. The goal is to create a system optimized for ethical hacking practice and tasks that require hardware or OS flexibility beyond what macOS allows.

# 🧠⚙️ Thought Process

This project was born out of frustration that very quickly turned into creativity.

Despite owning a high-end MacBook Pro (M4 Max, 64GB RAM), I kept encountering limitations — especially when it came to ethical hacking labs and GPU-intensive tasks. Apple’s ecosystem often prevents me from running the tools and environments I need (e.g., GPU acceleration, custom OS setups, etc.).

So, instead of replacing my MacBook, I decided to build a remote companion workstation — a system that complements it. Something I can connect to over the network, turn it remotely on and off when ever I want, and use it for whatever macOS restricts.

Use cases include:
	•	Penetration testing and ethical hacking labs
	•	GPU-based cracking tasks (e.g., WPA/WPA2 handshake with wordlists)
	•	Running any OS I need via virtualization or dual-boot
	•	Creating a future home server/lab environment
