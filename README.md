# 🖥️🛜 Remote Workstation – Project Overview

This repository documents the process of building a powerful remote-access workstation, designed to compliment my MacBook Pro and expand its capabilities for ethical hacking and high-performance tasks.

# 🧠⚙️ Thought Process

This project started out of frustration — yet quickly turned into creativity.

Although I own a top-tier MacBook Pro (M4 Max, 64GB RAM), I kept hitting limitations — especially when dealing with ethical hacking labs and GPU-intensive operations. Apple’s ecosystem often restricts access to essential tools, OS customization, and hardware acceleration (e.g., GPU cracking).

Instead of replacing my MacBook, I chose a more creative path. Building a remote companion — a machine I can access from anywhere, power on/off remotely, and use for tasks that macOS unfortunately restrict.

# 🔧 Primary Use Cases:
	•	💻 Penetration testing and ethical hacking labs
	•	⚡ GPU-based cracking (e.g., WPA/WPA2 handshakes with large wordlists)
	•	🧪 Running custom OSes via virtualization or dual-boot
	•	🏠 Hosting a home lab/server environment for continuous learning
