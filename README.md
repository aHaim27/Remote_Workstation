# Remote_Workstation Project explanation 🖥️🛜

This is a repository for a workstation built for using remotely from a laptop in order to execute and practice ethical hacking

# Thought Process 🧠⚙️

I started this project out of frustration. My Macbook struggles using it's amazing hardware (M4 Max, 64GB RAM).
most of the things I want to try and practice, I find unable because Apple stops me.
that's why I went on a mission to make myslef something that I can use my current Macbook as a boost.

Something that will complete it, not replace it.

I want to make a practice lab, a home server and a powerful enough hardware to connect from a far my Macbook to in order to use anything my Macbook won't allow me (currently: a powerful GPU & any OS I want...)
the first thing I plan on using it for is WPA/WPA2 handshake crack with a wordlist on my home network.

# 1st milestone - Planning and ordering 📝💲

Finished deciding what parts of hardware to use and purchased all the parts.
