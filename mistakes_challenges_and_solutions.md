## ⏩ Mistakes and challenges I faced during this project:

# • June:
- The main part of building a workstation such as this is understanding the relationship between hardware and software.
What the software needs and how the hardware fits that specific purpose without over-spending in a very flashy market.

- The biggest challenge I faced to this very day is learning to balance my tech enthusiasm along side with my military service.
this makes me feel slow and over-whelmed when studing on-duty but I am a very motivated person and it makes me focus and more discipline while studing at home.
